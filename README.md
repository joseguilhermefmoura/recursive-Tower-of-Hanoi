# Tower of Hanoi: the recursive solution.
**How many ways are there to solve this problem?**

There are two common ways of thinking of how to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with programming: either using the iterative version or the recursive version. 

**So why to use the recursive version in this case?**

Recursion may be very useful when you need to make a clear code and generally it's easier to understand. The iterative version of Tower of Hanoi takes several lines of code while the recursive algorithm can give us the same solution using only some couples of lines.

**Is the recursive version faster?**

It's not simple to say if a recursive solution to a problem is faster or slower than the iterative solution, because people write code in different ways for the same problem using more ou less lines. Thus, it makes the running time being different for each case. If you need to solve a huge problem and you're also looking for more speed in your code, then you probably should do it iterative. *Recursion it's generally slower* (for sure if you're dealing with huge problems), but the difference of time is not so big...
